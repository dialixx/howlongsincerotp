		<p class="text">We've been waiting awhile for the update for Monolith: Relics of the Past to release, and we thought it 
		appropriate for us to count the days since RotP released, seeing as there are people doing it for games like Silksong.</p><br>
		
		<p class="text">It has been</p>
		<h1 class="text2" id="days"></h1>
		<p class="text">since the initial release of RotP in its unfinished state.</p><br>
		
		<p class="text">If you're here and you somehow didn't learn about Monolith along the way, it's a top down shmup 
		roguelike which bears an incredible amount of polish in its current state with its DLC. I highly recommend you 
		check it and its DLC out, for like 15 bucks total it's an incredible experience. Here's a couple links for you.</p>
		
		<p class="text">The steam page for Monolith: 
		<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/603960/Monolith/" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/603960/Monolith/</a><br>
		(Many veterans of the game suggest you buy both the base-game and DLC together for a smoother experience, as the DLC 
		provides many quality of life features as well as a whole sea of new content that meets or surpasses the quality of 
		the base-game content.)

		<p class="text">The community wiki for the game, which while still under construction, contains much of the information you'll
		need to know to play the game (some information may need to be corrected, and spoilers of course!):<br>
